Welcome Golfers! Since 2003 StatGolf has helped golfers of all levels improve their golf game by storing a detailed account of each round played. You can track everything from courses played to putts made. StatGolf will identify strengths and weaknesses for every part of your game. StatGolf calculates your handicap based upon the USGA handicap formula. Your handicap is updated immediately after every round.
<br><br>
<b>Update:</b>  Going forward we will be charging an annual fee of $35.  New users can sign up and use the site and all it's features for a free 30 day trial period.  By popular demand we have added the concept of tees to Statgolf.  We have also added more data validation and changed the menus a little, but you’ll mostly notice the tees.
