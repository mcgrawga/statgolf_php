<br><b>12/09/2008:</b>  We have just finished developing a new product called StatGolf Club.
It is a club web site and a handicap computation service.  Check it out <a href="cpdemo.php">here</a> and if you 
are interested in using or know of a club that is you can contact me here:  <a href="mailto:garthmcgraw@statgolf.com">garthmcgraw@statgolf.com</a>.
</p>


<p>
<br><b>08/15/2008:</b>  To users that do not have a first name in the system: Your scores, when
they appear on the front page, will be attributed to Bob.
If you would like your actual name to appear next to you score please login, go the the account admin page and update your name.</a>
</p>


<p>
<br><b>07/28/2008:</b>  I've noticed that some names are not showing up on the home page
where I'm listing the 10 most recent scores.  These are users that have been using the site since before
I made name a required field when signing up.  To those people, if you would like your name (first only) to appear
next to you score please go the the account admin page and update your account info.</a>
</p>

<p>
<br><b>07/27/2008:</b>  Before you manually add a new course to your account you can search all courses
entered by Statgolf users.  If you find the course you want you can copy it to your account.  Try it out
from the golf courses page.</a>
</p>

<p>
<br><b>07/26/2008:</b> I've added the 10 most recent scores to the homepage.  I've also added some error checking to help
ensure that users don't switch the slope and course ratings around when entering a course.  It was a common
issue that numerous users reported.  It is simple check so I decided rather than answer email questions
about what was wrong, I would stop it before it happened.  Happy Golfing.
</p>

<p>
<br><b>05/23/2008:</b> Tonight I deployed a fix for a bug that was not allowing zero to be entered as a putt total.  Thanks
to several StatGolf users for bringing the issue to my attention.  I would have never discovered the bug on my own for one obvious reason...
it takes some skill to chip in and be able to record zero putts.  I can't even remember the last time I one putted a green!  But I 
digress.

<br>I recently purchased a used Calloway Big Bertha 460 and am very happy with it.  I ordered it online from the Calloway Golf Pre-Owned site.
The listed condition on the site was "like new" and I was pleasantly suprised when I received the club and it looked just like new.  The only wear
that was visible was on the grip, and that was very minimal.  Other than the grip it looked brand new.  Here is a link to the site:  
<a href="http://callawaygolfpreowned.com/default.aspx">callawaygolfpreowned.com</a>  Again I get nothing for referals, just thought I would pass
along a site I found valuable.
</p>

<p>
<br><b>04/22/2008:</b> I've decided to make StatGolf free for everybody.  I wasn't making enough money to matter
and it was disheartening to see new users enter a bunch of scores and then abandon the site when their trial period
expired.  I've learned that I get more satisfaction seeing everyone actively using StatGolf rather than watching a lot of
new users walk away and cashing in on those that are left.  Now my goal is simple, grow the user base by adding quality features.
</p>

<p>
<br><b>02/14/2008:</b> We’ve added more functionality in the statistics section.  
Now you have three general options when reviewing your stats.  You can look at the trends for your overall game.  
You can narrow your focus and review trends on a specific course or you can study hole by hole statistics for a 
single course, i.e. average number of putts, average score or ratio of birdies to pars on a particular hole.  
The best part of the hole by hole view is that it tells you what hole(s) are your best and which are your worst.  
You can focus and play conservatively on the worst holes and improve your scores simply through course management.  
</p>

<p>
<br><b>02/04/2008:</b> We have added a new section to the statistics area that lets golfers view their statistics for a specific course
over a specified date range.  The stats are available at the individual hole level, avg putts by hole, avg score by hole, num birdies by hole, etc...
It is a valuable tool that highlights strengths and weaknesses so golfers can target areas for improvement.
</p>

<p>
<br><b>12/11/2007:</b> We added some nice graphs to the statistics  
section.  Unfortunately the graphs illustrated what I already knew about my game.  Oh well, they are still a nice addition.<br><img src="img/statsOneSmall.png" border="1" />
</p>

<p>
<br><b>11/22/2007:</b> Statgolf just got a new look and feel.
We have also added the concept of tees, which was long overdue.
