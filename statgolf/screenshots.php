		The homepage is where your handicap and all of your scores are listed.  The list of scores is sortable by date, 
		course and score.  The scorecard for each round listed is available by clicking on the date.  The scores listed
		in red are the scores used to calculate your handicap which is displayed at the top of the page.  Everything you see
		in StatGolf when you are logged in is specific to your account.  No other users can view your scores, statistics, golf courses or
		rounds.  StatGolf is personalized to you and your game in an effort to help you understand and identify strenths and weaknesses.

		StatGolf offers a statistics section that breaks your game down and helps you identify strengths and weaknesses 
		for every part of your game.  StatGolf analyzes your game over time so you can see the areas of your game that are improving
		and the areas that have the most opportunity for improvement.  Best Score, Average Score, Worst Score, Putts Per Green, 
		Fairways Hit, Greens in Regulation and Penalties per Round are a few of the most useful statistics kept and trended by StatGolf

		Once you have entered a course into StatGolf you can begin entering rounds played at that course.  You do so using the
		course scorecard.  You just select the correct set of tees and enter your score hole by hole.  Click the save score button
		and you are done.  After you save the score you will instantaneously be taken to your StatGolf home page where your new score 
		will automatically be visible and included in your most recent handicap index if necessary.

		The golf courses section is where you go to add a course to StatGolf.  You can also edit and/or delete
		courses in this section as well.  You only have to enter a course once and then you can enter as many 
		rounds played on the course as you would like.
